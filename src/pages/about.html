        Hello!  First off, we want to thank you for being curious about Blissfest!
      </p>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        Blissfest began in the backyard of Analog Studios in 2020 as a 2-day music series featuring all Rhode Island based artists.  It was our way to host and celebrate local music during the pandemic, right here at our home on Bliss Road.  In 2021 we added a third day to the event for a full docket of performers on 3 stages, with campfires &amp; BBQ&apos;s each night.

        Last year&apos;s Blissfest was a little different.
      </p>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        Blissfest 2023 was a one-day showcase on Saturday July 29th from 5-11pm.  The biggest change that year was our location.  We were very excited to be hosting the event at IYRS on Thames Street in downtown Newport.  Again, with our focus on Rhode Island musicians, our stage and performances took place inside IYRS&apos; flagship building, Restoration Hall.

        Ordained with over a dozen two-story arched windows and crowned with a mezzanine section for overhead viewing, this space graciously provides amazing views of the harbor and a unique place to be inspired. It was originally built as the first home to the Newport Illumination Co. providing light to the city, and is now the heart of IYRS&apos; wooden boat building courses.  It was an honor to bring Blissfest to you from this space!
