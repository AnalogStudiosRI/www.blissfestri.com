        The Ocean State's indie music festival!
      </h1>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        Hello!  First off we'd like to thank you for being curious about Blissfest!  Blissfest started in 2020 as a 2-day backyard music series featuring all Rhode Island based artists.  It was our way to celebrate local music during the pandemic.  In 2021 we added another day, making it a 3-day event of campfires, BBQ, and with performers on 3 different stages.   This year is a little different.</p>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        Blissfest 2023 will be a one-day showcase on Saturday July 29th from 5-11pm.  Most importantly, this year we are very excited to be at IYRS Restoration Hall on Thames St in downtown Newport.  Restoration Hall is IYRS's flagship building.  It graciously provides amazing views of the harbor and houses one of the coolest venue spaces in Newport.

        Restoration hall is ordained with over a dozen two story arched windows and crowned with a mezzanine section for overhead viewing.   Originally it was the first home of the Newport Illumination Co.

        Blissfest will also have an outdoor area that flows out and onto the pier section which is great for stepping out and catching a view of Newport harbor.
