We at Analog Studios are excited to formally announce our kickoff for Blissfest 2023, taking place this year at IYRS!  We are looking forward to being able to expand out and take advantage of the space, hospitality, and the opportunity IYRS can offer us as we bring some of the best local indie music to downtown Newport this year.

Although more artists will get added over the next couple of weeks, we are thrilled to announce the following artists to the lineup:

- Jabbawaukee
- Analog
- Bill Bartholomew
- The Z-Boys
- Allysen Callery

You can head on over to the [tickets](/tickets/) page to get your spot in line, or check out [the FAQ page](/faq/) for general information about the event.  Any remaining questions?  Visit our [contact](/contact/) page and shoot us a message!

We are looking forward to seeing you out there this year and as always, keep it reel! ✌️
