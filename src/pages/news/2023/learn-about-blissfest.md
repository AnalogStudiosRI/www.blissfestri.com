For all those who have wanted to learn more about Blissfest and our exciting new location this year, at IYRS Restoration Hall, we have created an [About page](/about/) for all those who would love to learn more!

On this page we have included a brief history of Blissfest, some cool pictures of the venue, as well as a live video walkthrough and showcase of the venue and the VIP room presented by Dave Flamand!  

What's the VIP room you ask?  Check out the video then visit our [tickets page](/tickets/) to learn more and reserve your spot today!

We look forward to seeing you at this year's Blissfest! ✌️
