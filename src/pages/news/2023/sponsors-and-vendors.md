<bf-vendor-card
  class="mb-12"
  name="Alexander Perrine"
  bio="At the core of Alexâ€™s work is the juxtaposition of the beauty of the human form as celebrated in Greek sculpture and the ongoing issue of the degradation of the planet. His body of work is visually engaging, and thought-provoking. It illustrates our dependency on the material world, and the harm we do to it by the careless use and disposal of materials."
