We at Analog Studios are excited to formally announce our kickoff for Blissfest 2023, taking place this year at IYRS!  We are looking forward to being able to expand and take advantage of the space, hospitality, and the opportunity IYRS can offer us as we bring some of the best local Rhode Island indie music to downtown Newport this year.

Although more artists will get added over the next couple of weeks, are thrilled to announce the following artists to the lineup

- Jabbawaukee
- Analog
- Bill Bartholomew
- The Z-Boys
- Allysen Callery
